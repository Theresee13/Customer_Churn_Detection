# Customer Churn Prediction

## Introduction
Customer churn prediction is the process of identifying customers who are likely to cancel their subscription to a service based on their usage patterns and behaviors. It is a critical task for businesses, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model to determine whether a customer is likely to exit (churn) based on historical data about their behavior and interactions with the service. The insights generated by the model will enable businesses to take proactive measures to retain customers and reduce churn rates.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is Churn_Modelling.csv, which includes various features related to customer demographics, financial behavior, and service engagement.

### Features:
- *RowNumber*: Row index of the data (used for reference only).
- *CustomerId*: Unique identifier for each customer.
- *Surname*: Customer's last name.
- *CreditScore*: Customer's credit score.
- *Geography*: Customer's geographic location.
- *Gender*: Customer's gender.
- *Age*: Customer's age.
- *Tenure*: Number of years the customer has been with the company.
- *Balance*: Customer's account balance.
- *NumOfProducts*: Number of products the customer uses.
- *HasCrCard*: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- *IsActiveMember*: Whether the customer is an active member (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- *EstimatedSalary*: Customer's estimated annual salary.

### Label (Target):
- *Exited*: Indicates whether the customer has exited the service (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

## Project Steps
1. *Data Preprocessing*: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Analyze the data to understand the distribution of features and identify patterns related to customer churn.
3. *Feature Selection*: Select the most relevant features for the predictive model.
4. *Model Building*: Train and evaluate different machine learning models to predict customer churn.
5. *Model Evaluation*: Assess the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. *Model Deployment*: Deploy the best-performing model for real-time prediction of customer churn.

## Conclusion
The predictive model developed in this project can help businesses identify customers who are likely to churn and take proactive measures to retain them. By reducing churn rates, businesses can improve customer retention and increase profitability.
